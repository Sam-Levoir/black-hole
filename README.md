TODO: Put Photo of finished keyboard here

## Requirements 
- To Create:
    - 3D printer

- To Customize:
    - Python 3.10+
    - Vs Code
    - OpenSCAD

## Goals and how to achieve them
- Comfortable
    - Integrated wrist wrest
        - Have slot for memory foam wrist wrest?
    - Figure out tenting angle
    - Small number of keys for minimal finger travel, probably 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 and then 3 for left thumb?

    - Tape mod
    - File with foam or silicon or something?
    - Try putting foam between switch and switch holder thing
    - Add weights?

    - Utilize 3D printable wiring helpers
    - Nice microcontroller holder - Look through other repos?
- Can play games

            - Editing the code
                - This was meant to be edited in VS code:
                    - Recommended extensions in VS code settings
                        - Get vs code settings going
